# Via

An efficient text editor written in Rust. If you've ever used Vim, you'll immediately be able to use Via. However, Via was built from the ground up and is a very separate project from any other text editor out there. It runs anywhere Rust can compile, and only has one external dependency to get you started as soon as possible. It even supports using a mouse! It has many structures like a piece table that would be useful in other projects as well. This project was done as a proof of concept for future, more GUI-oriented text editors.

**This software is in alpha. Don't use it for anything important**
